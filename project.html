        <div class="desc">In module 4, for the course ProfDev, I did a challenge where I made a website. With this website I wanted to learn about branding, and improve the soft skills associated with it. This <a target="blank"
            href="https://bjarnesmink.github.io/mysite/"> website </a> was made for the start-up company Voort Varend. </div>

        <div class="desc">In module 3 in 2024, I along with my teammembers, created an interactive <a target="blank"
            href="http://futurecampus.troygordon.nl/choices.html"> website </a> for the Living and Working Tomorrow project. This website was made for the client SURF, they wanted to show policymakers of campuses what the future might hold, with as goal that these policymakers would think about the future. For this we decided to make a decision-based game, which has deifferent outcomes based on your choice. These outcomes were drastically exaggerated, but did the job.</div>

        <div class="desc">In module 2 (2023/2024), for the course <a target="blank"
                href="https://create2021.utwente.nl/doc/ProfessionalDevelopment.pdf"> Profdev </a>, I had to choose a
            challenge. This was the first challenge I had to choose myself, one of the criteria was that the challenge
            had to tackle one of the ProfDev pillars. So, I decided to tackle the deepening & widening pillar, to be
            specific "outside curriculum based". The challenge I chose was, learning how to draw with a dippen. As I had
            gotten one for my birthday a few years ago and I hadn't used it before, I was interested in learning how to
            use it. To reach my goal, I first made a drawing as a baseline check and afterwards I followed an online
            tutorial. The above image is the result of the tutorial, I personally saw a big improvement in the way my
            drawing looks, as I had learned new techniques and how to apply them. As a result of this course, I have
            gained more motivation to continue drawing with dippen.</div>

        <div class="desc">In module two (2023/2024), as part of the "Smart Environments Project", I and six other
            teammates had to research a chosen problem within the theme of "Light and Life" and find a solution for said
            problem, and the solution had to be a "smart environment". The problem we tried to solve was, insufficient
            lighting in study environments. As a solution we came up with a smart light, which adapt its colour and
            brightness to its environment. The circuit diagram of this system is described above. Our light did work as
            intended, as it changed colour dependant on the sound level of its environment. As this was our first real
            challenge, I mostly learned how to cooperate together in a team and work on a project.</div>

        <div class="desc">In the last year of high-school in 2022/2023, I along with two other teammates, made a project
            on the instructions of <a target="_blank" href="https://demcon.com/nl/">"Demcon"</a>. This project had as
            goal to design a small assignment for all students from the ages 9 up to and untill 14, where they get to
            know Demcon, the world of mechatronics, and coding. We decided on making a robot-kit for a self-driving
            robot that could follow a line all by itself, along with a manual. With this manual the students would be
            able to assemble and code the robot-kit. The goals were reached and the designed robot was able to follow a
            line all by itself and a manual was made.</div>

        </a>
        <div class="desc">In 2021/2022, I along with three students, made a project for <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.ctt-twente.nl/">"CTT"</a>". This project had as goal too prevent damage on cranes and
            containers by using sensors. As crane operateors sometimes drop the containers too hard, the containers
            along with the crane might get damaged, and will have to be serviced sooner. To reduce damage and costs a
            system with two sensors, accelerometer and sound sensor, was designed to detect if the crane was coming down
            too fast. I the speed was too high a signal would be given to the crane operator to reduce it's speed. At
            the end of the project, the sensors worked, but a real system was not realised. But the concept did work.

                href="https://www.vdletg.com/nl">"VDL etg"</a>. This was part from a high-school course, called <a
                target="_blank" href="https://www.technasium.nl/">"Technasium"</a>. The goal of the project was, to make
            a vision system that could detect defects in products. The results were a working vision system, that could
            detect these defects. This vision system was made using machine learning.</div>
